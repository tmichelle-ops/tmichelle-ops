👋 Hi, I’m Tamika and welcome to my GitHub space. If you are fond of sustainability 🌎 and eco-tourism 🧳, you have come to the right place.

👩‍💻 My business, KeyWee Sustainability LLC, focuses on providing education and solutions to businesses and customers searching for more eco-friendly options when it comes to traveling. We want to bring eco-tourism to the urban environment and improve our communities closer to home. We also support individuals who are in lower socio-economic communities to have access to more sustainable solutions that are affordable.
  
  - 🧠 I’m passionate about data, logistics, and the environment. I hope to merge these passions into a career that will help businesses make stronger data-driven decisions that help improve our environment long-term.
    
  - 🏫 I’m currently on track to start my MBA with a concentration in Data Analytics at the University of West Georgia in Spring 2025! Super excited to put my knowledge to use toward my passions.

Looking forward to geeking out with you about data 💻 and the environment 🌲!!!

⚡ Fun fact: I try to have a healthy balance between going on hikes in North GA Mountains, playing with my 2 adorable dogs Lucas (14 years old) and Henny (2 years old), playing RPGs on Playstation and Nintendo, planning a wedding in October 2025 to a data analyst who I love, reading legal thrillers and binge watching true crime documentaries.

Lets just say, I play with my dogs 🐶 more often than anything!!!

Tamika 😃 💚
